InView by FaceSnap is a real-time web application that detects and tracks faces in live video streams. Powered by CV2, a Python library utilizing a Haar cascade algorithm for efficient face recognition, it zooms in on detected faces and applies selectable filters for customized visual styles. With Flask handling the backend and HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend, FaceTrace provides an intuitive and interactive platform for dynamic face tracking and transformation. InView simplifies content creation by providing real-time face tracking and filtering, catering specifically to content creators' need for centered faces in recordings. Unlike Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, InView offers a cost-effective, user-friendly solution that eliminates the need for post-stream editing.
